Normalization Problem: 
This code generates a 5x5 NumPy array, x, filled with random values between 0 and 1 using the np.random.rand() function. It then computes the mean (x_mean) and standard deviation (x_std) of the array using the .mean() and .std() methods. To normalize the array, the Z-score normalization formula Z = (X - X_mean) / X_std is applied, standardizing the data. The resulting normalized array, x_normalized, is saved to a file named 'X_normalized.npy' using the np.save() function. Finally, the code prints both the original and normalized arrays, along with their respective mean and standard deviation, to provide a visual confirmation of the results 

Divisible by 3 Problem:
This code creates an array, A, of squares of numbers from 1 to 100 using the np.arange() function and squares each element. The array is then reshaped into a 10x10 matrix using the .reshape() method. From this matrix, elements divisible by 3 are selected using the condition A % 3 == 0 and stored in the variable div_by_3. The selected elements are saved to a .npy file named 'div_by_3.npy' for future use, using the np.save() function. Additionally, the code defines a function display_div_by_3() that formats and prints the elements of the original array A, with each element displayed in a 6-character wide column. Finally, the code prints the array of squares divisible by 3, providing a clear output of the selected elements.
