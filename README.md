Normalization Problem: 
This code creates a 5x5 matrix of random values with NumPy, normalizes the values to be between 0 and 1, then saves the normalized matrix to a file called x_normalize.npy. The original and normalized matrices are both displayed on the output. The matrix values are normalized by scaling them depending on the original matrix's minimum and maximum values. 

Divisible by 3 Problem:
This codeÂ generates a 10x10 array of squares numbered 1 to 100 and picks the components that are divisible by three. The selected components are stored in a file called div_by_3.npy.
